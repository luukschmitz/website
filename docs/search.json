    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "Governing by Exception\n\nWorking paper\nThe EU’s Recovery and Resilience Fund, the flexibility around EU state aid and fiscal rules, as well as member state industrial policies have one thing in common: they extensively exploit treaty flexibility and exceptions, if not outright violating them. As governing by exception seems to be the only way forward in a highly politicized and institutionally rigid environment, it is key to understand both the drivers and consequences of this emerging regime governing EU economic policy."

    "section": "Changing the Calculus on Economic Security",
    "text": "Changing the Calculus on Economic Security\n\nAfter several decades of intensifying globalization, the world has entered a new phase of strategic competition centered around geoeconomic motives. Buzzwords such as reshoring and de-risking dominate policy discourse and quarterly earnings reports. The mainstream economic view centered around price signals and factor endowment increasingly struggles to explain the security-based choices forced on firms and markets by policy makers. How has this security-based logic entered into polycymakers’ rulebooks? Why is security supplanting efficiency as a calculative logic? And to what extent does this change open more public pathways to scrutinize economic policy? The aim of this project is to find out not only the drivers and coalitions behind the changing economic calculus, but also to see whether this moment repoliticizes economic policy. Depoliticization through international law and the empowerment of expertise-driven and technocratic institutions such as central banks and credit rating agencies were arguably the hallmark of economic policymaking in the last decades. While the move to bolster economic security is the first genuine challenge to this constellation, it carries its own sources of depoliticization that, once again, remove economic and distributive choices from spheres of public debate and democratic accountability."
