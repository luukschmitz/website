    "text": "After several decades of intensifying globalization, the world has entered a new phase centered around geoeconomic fragmentation. Terms such as de-globalization, decoupling, and de-risking have entered public discourse and corporate reports, and increasingly shape policy interventions as governments vie to position themselves in a geopoliticizing world. An economic view centered around efficiency and factor endowment increasingly struggles to explain the security-based choices forced on firms and markets by states. From an efficiency-based point of view, replicating entire value chains within national borders is a form of economic downgrading. If so, why does this happen?\nThe core intuition behind the project is to place (real or imagined) security imperatives center stage. The aim of this project is to find out how such imperatives increasingly shape economic policy interventions, as well as corporate decision-making. We currently lack the theoretical and methodological toolkit to tackle such questions.\nThe project goes beyond the usual ‘supply-side’ bias in the literature, which has so far mostly analyzed policy documents and individual companies. I have collected an original data set of corporate earnings calls (n=14.101) that involves more than 4500 companies and spans eight years (starting in 2016). The large number of firms allows for a large-scale and nuanced analysis of how geoeconomic competition affects firms and sectors across time. In a first step, I aim to map theoretically and empirically what such an economic ‘calculus’ is, and how it is changing. In a follow-up paper, I want to analyze who are the winners and losers of geoeconomic competition."

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "Hello! I am a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG) in Cologne. I hold a PhD in political and social science from the European University Institute with a dissertation on European industrial policy.\nMy research deals with the political economy of geoeconomics. I am interested in how multinational firms operate under geoeconomic tensions, how geoeconomics reshape trade and investment patterns, and how this affects decarbonization and the green transition. Geographically, I focus mostly on the European Union. Additionally, I have an interest in computational social science, and how we can bridge the gap between linguistics, computer science, and political science.\nYou can find more information about my research, publications, and contact info on this website. I occasionally post miscellaneous entries in my blog on more general academic interests."

Given the EU’s market-making impetus, tilt towards fiscal austerity, and limits to subsidizing state aid, the turn to an active and targeted industrial policy in the last years is surprising. My dissertation documents this moment of After Market Making. I argue that a declining belief in open markets and economic efficiency as the sole propagators of ‘good’ economic outcomes has mobilized a coalition of firms, business associations, and trade unions to challenge the EU’s market-based governance regime. This is visible in EU trade policy, now understood in terms of open strategic autonomy, and especially visible in digital and high-tech fields and in the green transition, often discussed under the rubric of the ‘twin transitions’.\nPost-PhD, I will focus on understanding how the demands for state intervention play out on the ground: can market-making institutions be repurposed for state intervention?"

As governing by exception seems to be the only way forward in a highly politicized and institutionally rigid environment, it is key to understand both the drivers and consequences of this emerging regime governing EU economic policy."

    "section": "Mesonomics: Rescaling political economy",
    "text": "Mesonomics: Rescaling political economy\n\nA major challenge for comparative and international political economists is the discrepancy between the behavior of statistical aggregates and individual agents. Our theories and methods of accounting remain separated between macro-institutional processes and micro-level outcomes that focus on individual firms, organizations, and sectors. To assume away complexity by ignoring one or the other is to engage in what Thomas Oatley has called the reductionist gamble. With the advent of economic statecraft and the weaponization of markets for geopolitical purposes comes an urgent need to understand how states and firms interact across markets, supply chains, and financial networks. The discovery of such meso-level processes has been labeled mesonomics. The more widespread availability of firm-level data and the computational methods to analyze them now allows political economists to get more serious about addressing these questions.\nIn my current work, firm-level data plays a major role. Apart from the economic calculus project outlined above, I use data on the automobile industry to map the geographical dispersion and organization of car makers’ supply chains."
