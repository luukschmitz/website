# I. The old and new calculus {#sec-markdown}

## Efficiency and security

<br>

Since the mid-2010s, we see a ‘growing confidence in governments’ ability to reshape their economies for the better’ [@Wolf.2023] and a declining confidence that markets ‘always allocate capital productively and efficiently’ [@Sullivan.2023]. 'These policies \[...\] are driven by straightforward national security considerations. We will not comrpomise on these concerns, even when they force trade-offs with our economic interests' [@Yellen.2023].

## The argument: efficiency reloaded

<br><br>

What is considered to be 'good' economic policy and good business strategy is remolded through economic security considerations.

## The paper

<br><br>

1.  Literature review: combining IR and IPE

2.  Theory: efficiency reloaded

3.  Case studies on U.S. and EU turn towards economic security in trade and industrial policies

4.  Quantitative analysis of all corporate earnings calls that mention 'geopolitics' (n=13.875) as a way to study firms' revealed preferences [cf. @Weber.2023] using GPT-4.0 Turbo.

5.  The Janus-faces of economic security (democratic choice, lock-out for emerging economies)

# II. Empirical dive

## Empirical dive: earnings calls

<br>

All earnings calls with statements about 'geopolitics' (or related terms) since 01-01-2016. Source: S&P's Capital IQ.

# III. Wrapping up

## Conclusion

<br>

-   Re-interpreting economic policies through the lens of security sheds light on government strategies and empirical trends (geoeconomic fragmentation, but no full-scale deglobalization).

-   There is a need to create new frameworks to not only understand economic policies and firm choices, but also to evaluate them.

-   Janus-face #1: depoliticization and technocracy were the hallmarks of neoliberal globalization. Will it now be replaced by another form of depoliticization?

-   Janus-face #2: while some countries will benefit from the shift from JIT to JIC [@Mercurio.2024], countries buried under debt gluts will struggle to bear the adjustment costs [@Mackenzie.2023].

You will categorize the text as 1 when Geopolitics and geopolitical factors such as war, sanctions, and regulatory uncertainty are flagged as general headwinds that make the business environment more challenging and uncertain, even if corporate performance remains strong. (Example sentence: delivered another quarter of strong financial results despite market concerns about slowing demand, broader macroeconomic challenges and the various global geopolitical issues. In fact, indicators of demand both from customers and in the market generally remain healthy.)
You will categorize the text as 2 when Geopolitics and geopolitical factors such as war, sanctions, and regulatory uncertainty are flagged as general opportunities or tailwinds. (Example sentence: Today, global defense spending is on the rise, driven by the Ukraine war, shifts in geopolitical dynamics and the U.S. Department of Defense modernization priorities. Allison is poised to capture growth in this cycle by continuing our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense, while diversifying our revenue sources by increasing our international sales.)
You will categorize the text as 3 when Geopolitics and geopolitical factors such as war, sanctions, and regulatory uncertainty are flagged as reasons directly imacting business and investment decisions. (Example sentence: The geopolitical tensions may amplify the supply chain challenges mentioned above, which we address with our supplier risk mitigation strategy, buying key products from multiple regions and manufacturers. The Chinese COVID policy may lead to further lockdowns in the country.)
As an absolute last resort, you will categorize the text as 4 when no clear sentiment towards geopolitics can be detected.
