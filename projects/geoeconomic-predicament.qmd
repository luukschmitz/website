## The Challenge to Market-Based Governance

Why is industrial policy *en vogue* in the European Union? Given the EU's market-making impetus, tilt towards fiscal austerity, and limits to subsidizing state aid, the turn to an active and targeted industrial policy in the last years is surprising. I argue that a declining belief in open markets and economic efficiency as the sole propagators of 'good' economic outcomes has mobilized a coalition of firms, business associations, and trade unions to challenge the EU's market-based governance regime.

## Manifestations

This is visible in EU trade policy, now understood in terms of *open strategic autonomy*, and especially visible in digital and high-tech fields and in the green transition, often discussed under the rubric of the 'twin transitions'.

## Future Research

Post-PhD, I will focus on understanding how the demands for state intervention play out on the ground: can market-making institutions be repurposed for state intervention?

Documenting the EU's surprising turn to active industrial policy and the challenge to market-based governance regimes.
